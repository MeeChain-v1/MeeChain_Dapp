# 📝 Smart Contract ABI Summary

This contract implements a robust ERC-20 token with advanced role and metadata management, burning/minting, and extended transfer functions.

---

## 🔑 Roles & Permissions

- `addMinter(address account)` – Grant minting permission to an address
- `isMinter(address account) → bool` – Check if address has minting rights
- `renounceMinter()` – Renounce minter status
- `isOwner() → bool` – Check if caller is contract owner
- `owner() → address` – Get contract owner address
- `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` – Transfer contract ownership
- `renounceOwnership()` – Renounce contract ownership

---

## 💰 Token Management

- `mint(address account, uint256 amount) → bool` – Mint new tokens to address
- `burn(uint256 amount)` – Burn tokens from caller
- `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)` – Burn tokens from another address (with allowance)
- `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool` – Transfer tokens
- `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool` – Transfer tokens using allowance
- `approve(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool` – Approve spender to use tokens
- `increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) → bool` – Increase allowance
- `decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) → bool` – Decrease allowance
- `allowance(address owner, address spender) → uint256` – View spender's allowance

---

## 📦 Token Information

- `name() → string` – Token name
- `symbol() → string` – Token symbol
- `decimals() → uint8` – Token decimals
- `totalSupply() → uint256` – Total token supply
- `balanceOf(address account) → uint256` – Account balance

---

## 🖼️ Metadata

- `setTokenURI(string tokenURI)` – Set metadata URI
- `tokenURI() → string` – Get metadata URI

---

## 📡 Extended Functionality

- `transferAndCall(address to, uint256 value, bytes data) → bool` – Transfer tokens and call recipient contract function (ERC-677/ERC-1363 style)
  - Transfers tokens to recipient address
  - If recipient is a contract, calls `onTokenTransfer(address,uint256,bytes)` function
  - Emits `TransferAndCall` event for DApp integration
  - Enables seamless token transfers with immediate contract interaction

---

## 📢 Events

- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)` – Standard ERC-20 transfer event
- `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)` – Standard ERC-20 approval event
- `TransferAndCall(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value, bytes data)` – Extended transfer with call event
- `TierUpgraded(address indexed user, uint8 newTier)` – User tier upgrade event
- `NFTRewardMinted(address indexed user, uint8 tier, uint256 tokenId)` – NFT reward minting event

---

## 🧩 Method IDs

Each method is addressable via its 4-byte selector, e.g.:
- `addMinter`: `0x983b2d56`
- `allowance`: `0xdd62ed3e`
- `approve`: `0x095ea7b3`
- `transferAndCall`: `0x4000aea0`
- ...and more.
